# R Project
This repository contains a collection of random R scripts that I've developed for various purposes.

## Usage
Each script is self-contained and can be run independently. Open the script in RStudio, adjust any parameters or file paths as necessary, and run the script using the "Run" button or by executing source("script_name.R") in the R console.
To run these scripts locally, ensure you have R and RStudio installed
